PolicyMisconfigurationDetection
===============================

Access Control Policy Misconfiguration Detection on Online Social Networks 

In this project I developed a tool to gather the users' sharing intentions, and present the possible misconfiguration in their policies by comparing them with their existing policies. Tagclouds were used during the intention collection step to assist them in composing secure policies. 
This tool scans the privacy threats in a user's Facebook albums and present a summary of their policy statistics, using engaging visualizations (such as Tag cloud and Tree map).
